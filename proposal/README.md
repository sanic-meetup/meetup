## Proposal \#1
### Project Name
The project name is **Free Time** (subject to change)

### App. Description
The web-app (which will also be a mobile app.) will be an app that broadcasts your availability and location to your friends. For example imagine you're just 'chilling' in BV473 and a friend just arrives on campus, rather than having them type "@PING who's on campus" in some sort of group chat (like facebook messenger), why not just have an app that lets them know who (including you) is on campus and available.

### Key Features (BETA)
- locating the app user (at UTSC)
- RESTful API that can successfully let the user know who's nearby
- RESTful API: friends list (adding ,removing, viewing), user logins (OAuth or Phone #'s or UserName + Pass), accounts, profiles, user status, etc.
- A usable front-end that allows the user to make use of above features meaningfully

### Additional Features (Final Ver.)
- polished web-app and mobile app.
- features not completed in BETA
- polished backend
- user location height location (i.e. what floor the user is on at UTSC to help determine exact room location)
- push notifications (for various stuff)

### Technology Stack
- React/ React Native (for mobile app)
- Node.js/Express/Passport/
- Twitter OAuth
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Native Swift (for when React Native isn't sufficient)
- Google Maps API
- Apple Core Location (for height location in buildings)

### Technical Challenges
- Learning React (and Native) FrameWorks
- Learning and Setting up Google Maps API
- Learning and Setting up Apple Core location
- (optional) Learn & work with Swift for iOS app
- Deploying and configuring RestAPI to work with mobile devices

<!--##Proposal \#2
